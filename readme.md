# Retro Snake Game

This is a simple snake game made with HTML, CSS and plain Javascript. The game is played on a 20x20 grid and the snake grows by one cell each time it eats the food. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## How to play

- Use the arrow keys to move the snake
- Press the space bar to start playing the game
- Change collision settings with the checkbox to turn off wall collision
- Foods change the speed of the snake
